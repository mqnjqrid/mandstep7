Airline database

As of January 2012, the OpenFlights Airlines Database contains 5888 airlines. Each entry contains the following information:
Airline ID 	Unique OpenFlights identifier for this airline.
Name 	Name of the airline.
Alias 	Alias of the airline. For example, All Nippon Airways is commonly known as "ANA".
IATA 	2-letter IATA code, if available.
ICAO 	3-letter ICAO code, if available.
Country 	Country or territory where airline is incorporated India.
Active 	"Y" if the airline is or has until recently been operational, "N" if it is defunct. This field is not reliable: in particular, major airlines that stopped flying long ago, but have not had their IATA code reassigned (eg. Ansett/AN), will incorrectly show as "Y".

The data is ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) encoded. The special value \N is used for "NULL" to indicate that no value is available, and is understood automatically by MySQL if imported.

Notes: Airlines with null codes/callsigns/countries generally represent user-added airlines. Since the data is intended primarily for current flights, defunct IATA codes are generally not included. For example, "Sabena" is not listed with a SN IATA code, since "SN" is presently used by its successor Brussels Airlines.

I added this line for practice and I deleted line 16  which said "sample entries" and changed line 10 by adding word "India".
I added this line for practice in step 7 second time and I deleted line 6 which said "Callsign 	Airline callsign." and I add word India in line 9 which I forgot previously.
